                <h2>1</h2><p> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>
                <h2>2</h2><p> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
                <h2>3</h2><p> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>

                <h2>4</h2><p> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</p>
                <h2>5</h2><p> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
                </p>
                <h2>6</h2><p> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>

                <h2>7</h2><p> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</p>
                    
                <h2>8</h2><p> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</p>
                    
                <h2>9</h2><p>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</p>

                 <h2>11</h2><p>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

                <h2>13</h2><p>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>
                    
                <h2>14</h2><p>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>
                   
                <h2>15</h2><p>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>
